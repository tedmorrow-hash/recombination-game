EvoSim: Recombination Master
Welcome to EvoSim, an interactive web-based simulation designed to explore the core principles of evolutionary biology. This tool allows students, educators, and the curious to see natural selection in action by directly manipulating key genetic and environmental factors.

ðŸš€ How to Play
The goal is to guide a population of digital organisms to survive and adapt over generations. You can control the two most powerful forces in evolution: genetics and the environment.

Controls
Play / Pause / Reset: Start, stop, and reset the simulation. Resetting will keep a "ghost" of your previous run on the chart for comparison!

Recombination Rate: Controls how much genetic material is shuffled between parents when creating offspring. High recombination creates new genetic combinations faster.

Selection Pressure: Represents the "harshness" of the environment. A high pressure means only the most "fit" individuals will survive to the next generation.

Understanding the Data
Stats Panel: Get a real-time snapshot of your population's health, including the current generation, population size, average fitness, and the number of extinction events.

Population Analytics Chart: This is where the story of your population unfolds.

Blue Line (Avg. Fitness): Tracks the average fitness of the population over time.

Red Line (Population): Shows the total number of living individuals. Watch out for sharp drops!

ðŸ”¬ Key Concepts for Students
This simulation is a model for several important evolutionary concepts:

What is "Fitness"?
In this simulation, an individual's fitness is determined by its "genome"â€”a string of 1s and 0s. Fitness is simply the percentage of '1's in the genome. A higher percentage means a more "fit" individual.

The Power of Recombination
When two parents create an offspring, recombination "shuffles" their genomes. A high recombination rate is like shuffling a deck of cards thoroughly, creating novel combinations of genes (some good, some bad) very quickly. This can be the key to rapid adaptation.

Survival of the Fittest (Selection Pressure)
The environment is the ultimate judge. When you increase the selection pressure, you are telling the simulation to be more ruthless in culling the least-fit individuals. This is natural selection in its most direct form.

ðŸŽ“ Educational Scenarios to Try
Use the simulator to run your own experiments!

The Adaptation Challenge: Set the Selection Pressure to a high level (e.g., 75%). Can you save the population from extinction by increasing the Recombination Rate?

The Cost of Stability: Set the Selection Pressure very low (e.g., 10%) and the Recombination Rate to zero. What happens to the average fitness over time in a stable, non-mixing population?

The Extinction Vortex: Start a healthy population and then suddenly crank the Selection Pressure to 90%. How many generations does it take for the population to collapse?
